1.Paul has bought a new notebook of "idol" brand, with a processor speed of 2.66GHz, 8 GB of RAM,
 500GB hard disk, with a 15-inch monitor, for $1760.55. He has chosen service plan 'C' among plans
 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D', plus on-site servicing but did not choose extended warranty. Identify the data types and name the variables.

2.You are asked to develop a software for a college. The system shall maintain information about students. 
This includes name, address, phone number, gender, date of birth, height, weight, degree pursued (e.g., B.Sc., B.A.), year of study, average GPA, with/without tuition grant, is/is not a scholar. Each student is assigned a unique 8-digit number as id.
You are required to identify the variables, assign a suitable name to each variable and choose an appropriate type. 
Write the variable declaration statements as in the above example.

3.When i is casted to c the value corresponding to the ascii code of 81 which is 'Q' is assigned.
When d is casted to i the decimal part .142 is truncated and only 323 is assigned to i.
Similarly when f is casted to i, the decimal part .38 is truncated and only 72 is assigned to i.
When d is casted to b whose range is -128 to 127, not only the decimal part .142 is truncated but it is also shortened from 323 to 67 so as to fit in byte range.

i = 81 c = Q
d = 323.142 i = 323
f = 72.38 i = 72
d = 323.142 b = 67
